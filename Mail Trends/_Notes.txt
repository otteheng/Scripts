NOTES on R Script
1.31.2022

Most of these graphs used in the Mail Trends were originally done as part of the Mail Floor Project.
I've pulled in only the R scripts that were used in the Mail Trends slides without changing the 
original ordering found in the Mail Floor project. 
 
If interested, the Mail Floor project R scripts can be found here:
