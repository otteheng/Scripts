Explain Files in this folder

The histogram and descriptive stats in this folder are for the old variable
MAIL.VOLUME.SUM. There was an error in creating MAIL.VOLUME.SUM leading it 
to include package received. I caught the mistake when Peter asked me to
include Mail Sent into our regressions in 2g_HDS. Added Mail sent and 
Packages sent in 2c_HDS.
